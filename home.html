                <strong>Tools</strong>

                <p>Any IDE or code editor of your choice (Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Netbeans, Notepad++ etc). You
                    will
                    need MySQL (probably already installed from last term) as well as NodeJS installed.</p>

                <p>We will use GitHub for our code management and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> for hosting our
                    projects.</p>
                <p>You will also need to install <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> for API testing (Links to an external
                    site.))</p>

                <strong>Assignments</strong>

                <p>This course will have 5 assignments, and a final project. (A Summative). The Summative will be a
                    group
                    project. You will be required to form groups of two. There will be two individual take home
                    assignments
                    and two group take home assignments, and an In-Class Quiz.</p>
                <p>The final project will build on the work we did for the Database Management Systems Class, and we
                    will
                    build a web application for manipulating that database.</p>

                <p>You should treat me as a client. I will give you a set of requirements. Requirements can be
                    interpreted
                    differently, this is unavoidable. You have to meet my interpretation of the requirements to get
                    maximum
                    credit. If you have any doubt about what a requirement means, you should ask me to clarify.</p>
